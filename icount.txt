Over the past year, my role extended beyond the technical aspects of my projects. I served as a mentor to 12 specialist programmers, aiding them in honing their technical skills. In parallel, as part of project execution, I had the opportunity to lead a team of approximately 15 developers, a mix of experienced professionals and freshers.

I specifically focused on imparting hands-on expertise in the implementation of reactive Java within Spring Web Flux projects, which is vital in our software development landscape. Furthermore, I conducted multiple sessions to dive deep into the intricacies of designing cloud-based, distributed, event-driven microservices.

This dual role allowed me to facilitate the growth of my team's technical acumen, from seasoned professionals to those entering the field. I eagerly anticipate continuing to contribute to our collective professional development in the year ahead.
