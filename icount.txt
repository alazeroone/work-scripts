Over the past year, I played a significant role in a microservices project for Walmart in the Retail - Health and Wellness domain. We built a cloud-native platform using Azure and GCP, leveraging design patterns like Strangler Fig, Sidecar, and more for robustness. Our tech stack included Java-Springboot for API development, Kubernetes for containerization, Python for data loading, and Cosmos/MSSQL for data storage. Dynatrace ensured real-time monitoring, and Splunk provided log analytics. The application of these design patterns and tech stack yielded a resilient, scalable, and reliable system. I eagerly look forward to further enhancing our software in the year ahead.
