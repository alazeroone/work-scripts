Over the past year, I've had the privilege to make significant contributions to our cloud-based microservices project. A key aspect of my work has been the thoughtful integration of advanced design patterns into our event-based microservices architecture. I've had the opportunity to design and implement more than 25 services, and the results have been exceptional.

The tech stack for this project has been diverse and sophisticated. We leveraged a client-specific cloud-native platform built on hyperscalers like Azure and GCP, which provided the foundation for our innovative approach. We utilized a range of technologies and tools to achieve our goals, including API development using Java-Springboot, containerization with Kubernetes for efficient deployment and scaling, and one-time data load jobs facilitated by Python. Our data was securely managed through Cosmos and MSSQL as backend databases, ensuring data consistency and performance.

Additionally, the integration of advanced design patterns, including the Strangler Fig Pattern, Sidecar, and Saga Distributed Transactions Pattern, all contributed to the robustness and integrity of our system. The Retry and Circuit Breaker patterns improved our service reliability, while the Bulkhead pattern isolated and limited the impact of potential failures. The commitment to following the 12-factor approach underscored the significance of design patterns in our project's success.

Our prioritization of observability was realized through Dynatrace, which facilitated real-time performance monitoring and tracing, while Splunk empowered us with comprehensive log analytics, offering insights into the system's behavior.

The integration of these design patterns, combined with our diverse and sophisticated tech stack, played a pivotal role in achieving superior performance, scalability, and reliability. I eagerly anticipate continuing to enhance our software and drive technological advancements in the year ahead.
