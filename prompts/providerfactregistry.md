Here’s a **documentable format** summarizing the decisions and schema updates for the **`providerfactregistry`** and **`tpsvsource`** tables.

# **Fact Code Registry and Verification System Design**

### **Objective**
To redesign the **`providerfactregistry`** table for scalability, maintainability, and clarity, while separating the verification method details to a more appropriate table (i.e., `tpsvsource`). This restructuring improves data integrity, reduces redundancy, and makes the schema more intuitive.

---

## **1. Renaming `tproviderfacttype` to `providerfactregistry`**
The `tproviderfacttype` table was renamed to **`providerfactregistry`** to reflect its role as a registry of all facts that are verified during provider onboarding and credentialing processes. 

### **Reasoning**:
- The new name better represents the purpose of the table as a central repository for fact types used in provider verification.
- The table now maintains an incrementing ID (`factRegistryId`) to uniquely identify each fact.

---

## **2. Incrementing ID for Uniqueness**
The previous design used a generated `code` for uniqueness. To simplify this and ensure each fact type is uniquely identifiable, we introduced an **auto-incrementing primary key** (`factRegistryId`).

### **New Column**: 
- **`factRegistryId` (INT, Primary Key)**: An auto-incrementing unique identifier for each fact in the registry.

### **Reasoning**:
- This ensures a unique and simple way to identify each record in the fact registry.
- The `code` field is retained for identification but is no longer used for uniqueness.

---

## **3. Normalization of `psvName` and `psvUrl`**
To avoid redundancy in the table, we normalized **`psvName`** and **`psvUrl`** into a separate table called **`tpsvsource`**. This table stores information about the **primary source verification (PSV)**, allowing different facts to link to the same verification source.

### **`tpsvsource` Table**:
- **`psvid` (INT, Primary Key)**: Unique identifier for each primary source.
- **`psvName` (VARCHAR)**: Name of the primary source (e.g., NPPES, DEA).
- **`psvUrl` (VARCHAR)**: URL of the primary source for verification.

### **Reasoning**:
- Normalizing these fields ensures that changes to the source name or URL need to be made in only one place, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

---

## **4. Moving `verificationMethod` to `tpsvsource`**
The **`verificationMethod`** column, which describes how verification is performed (e.g., automatic, manual, semi-automatic), was moved from the `providerfactregistry` table to the `tpsvsource` table. This change associates the verification method with the **source** itself, rather than each individual fact.

### **New Column in `tpsvsource`**:
- **`verificationMethod` (VARCHAR)**: The method of verification, describing how the data is verified (e.g., auto, manual, semi).

### **Reasoning**:
- The verification method typically applies to the source (e.g., DEA, NPPES), not to individual facts. Moving this column to the `tpsvsource` table reduces redundancy and ensures that verification methods are logically tied to their respective sources.

## **5. Updated Table Schemas**

### **`providerfactregistry` Table Schema**

| Column                   | Type        | Description                                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `factRegistryId`          | INT (PK)    | Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each fact in the registry.|
| `factCode`                | VARCHAR     | Generated code for the fact (non-unique, used for identification).|
| `providerLevelType`       | VARCHAR(50) | Provider's level type (e.g., Practitioner, Group).                |
| `factCategory`            | VARCHAR(50) | High-level category of the fact (e.g., Identifier, License).      |
| `factType`                | VARCHAR(50) | Specific type of the fact (e.g., NPI, DEA, MedicalLicense).       |
| `factSubType`             | VARCHAR(50) | Subcategory of the fact (e.g., Fellowship, Cardiology).           |
| `state`                   | VARCHAR(50) | State where the fact is applicable (optional).                    |
| `country`                 | VARCHAR(50) | Country where the fact is applicable.                             |
| `primarySourceId`         | INT (FK)    | Foreign key to `tpsvsource.psvid` for primary source details.     |
| `factDescription`         | TEXT        | Detailed description of the fact.                                 |

### **`tpsvsource` Table Schema**

| Column                   | Type        | Description                                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `psvid`                   | INT (PK)    | Auto-incrementing unique identifier for the primary source.       |
| `psvName`                 | VARCHAR(255)| Name of the primary source (e.g., NPPES, DEA, IRS).               |
| `psvUrl`                  | VARCHAR(255)| URL of the primary source for verification.                       |
| `verificationMethod`      | VARCHAR(50) | Method of verification (e.g., auto, manual, semi).                |

## **6. SQL Commands for Implementation**

### **Renaming `tproviderfacttype` to `providerfactregistry`**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tproviderfacttype RENAME TO providerfactregistry;
```

### **Adding Incrementing ID for Uniqueness**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE providerfactregistry ADD COLUMN factRegistryId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
```

### **Creating `tpsvsource` Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE tpsvsource (
    psvid INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    psvName VARCHAR(255),
    psvUrl VARCHAR(255),
    verificationMethod VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### **Updating `providerfactregistry` to Reference `tpsvsource`**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE providerfactregistry ADD COLUMN primarySourceId INT;
ALTER TABLE providerfactregistry ADD CONSTRAINT fk_psvid FOREIGN KEY (primarySourceId) REFERENCES tpsvsource(psvid);
```

### **Removing `verificationMethod` from `providerfactregistry`**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE providerfactregistry DROP COLUMN verificationMethod;
```

---

## **Conclusion**
This redesign of the **`providerfactregistry`** and **`tpsvsource`** tables ensures:
- Improved **scalability** and **data integrity**.
- **Normalization** of primary source verification details.
- Clear, logical association between **verification methods** and their corresponding **sources**.
- Simplified management of facts related to provider onboarding and credentialing.

This structure provides a scalable and maintainable approach to handling fact verification during provider onboarding and credentialing, while also allowing for easy updates and extensions as new verification sources or methods are added.
