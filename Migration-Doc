**1. Introduction**

**Purpose of the Document:**

This document outlines the plan for migrating appointment documents from the "patient" container to a new "appointment" container in Azure Cosmos DB. It also provides details on how to update the codebase to accommodate this migration.

**Scope of the Migration:**

The scope of this migration includes:
- Exporting existing appointment documents from the "patient" container.
- Importing these documents into the new "appointment" container.
- Updating the codebase to work with the new container structure.

**2. Migration Steps**

**2.1. Data Migration**

**2.1.1. Export Appointment Documents:**

To export appointment documents from the "patient" container, follow these steps:
- Create a backup of your existing data.
- Use Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration Tool or a custom script to export appointment documents. Ensure you capture all necessary fields.

**2.1.2. Import Appointment Documents into the New Container:**

To import appointment documents into the new "appointment" container, follow these steps:
- Create the new "appointment" container in Azure Cosmos DB.
- Use Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration Tool or a custom script to import the exported appointment documents into the new container.

**2.2. Code Update**

**2.2.1. Identify Code References:**

Identify all places in your codebase where you reference appointment documents from the "patient" container. These references might include API endpoints, queries, and data access methods.

**2.2.2. Modify Code for New Container:**

Update your codebase as follows:
- Replace references to the "patient" container with references to the new "appointment" container.
- Modify queries and data access methods to target the "appointment" container.
- Ensure that the data schema in your code matches the schema of the documents in the new container.

**2.2.3. Testing and Validation:**

Thoroughly test the updated code to ensure that it functions correctly with the new "appointment" container. Pay special attention to data retrieval, updates, and error handling.

**3. Rollout Plan**

**3.1. Development Environment:**

- Begin code updates in a development environment.
- Collaborate with development and testing teams to validate changes.
- Address any issues discovered during testing.

**3.2. Staging Environment:**

- Deploy the updated code to a staging environment.
- Perform end-to-end testing, including integration and regression testing.
- Ensure that all functionality works as expected.

**3.3. Production Environment:**

- After successful testing, deploy the updated code to the production environment.
- Monitor the application closely in the production environment for any unexpected behavior.

**4. Monitoring and Maintenance**

**4.1. Monitoring for Issues:**

Implement monitoring and alerting to detect any issues with data migration or code functionality. Monitor performance and errors related to the new "appointment" container.

**4.2. Handling Exceptions:**

Have a plan in place for handling exceptions and errors that may arise during and after the migration. Define procedures for rollback if necessary.

**4.3. Continuous Testing:**

Continue to test the application in the production environment to ensure ongoing stability. Address any issues promptly.

**5. Conclusion**

This document provides a comprehensive plan for migrating appointment documents from the "patient" container to the new "appointment" container in Azure Cosmos DB. It also outlines the necessary code updates and the rollout plan for each environment. By following this plan, we aim to ensure a smooth and successful migration process.
