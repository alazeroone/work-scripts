The lastUpdateTs field in appointment documents serves as a timestamp that indicates the last time a document was updated. It is used in the migration process to identify appointment documents that have been modified or created after the last migration run. Here's how the lastUpdateTs field is used in the migration logic:

Initialization:
The migration script or stored procedure initializes the lastMigrationTimestamp variable, which holds the timestamp of the last successful migration run.
Querying for Updated Documents:
During each migration run, the script queries the "patient" container using a SQL query that includes a filter condition. This condition compares the lastUpdateTs field of appointment documents with the lastMigrationTimestamp.
Identifying Updated Documents:
Appointment documents with a lastUpdateTs value greater than the lastMigrationTimestamp are considered "updated" or "new" since the last migration.
Migrating Updated Documents:
The script migrates these identified appointment documents to the new "appointment" container as part of the migration run.
Updating lastMigrationTimestamp:
After successfully migrating the documents, the script updates the lastMigrationTimestamp to the current timestamp. This ensures that during the next migration run, only documents modified or created after this new timestamp will be selected.
By using the lastUpdateTs field and maintaining the lastMigrationTimestamp, the migration process efficiently captures and migrates only the appointment documents that have changed or been added since the last migration run. This approach minimizes redundant data migration and ensures that the new "appointment" container contains the most up-to-date data.
